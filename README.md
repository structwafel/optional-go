# optional-go

A library for working with optional types in Go.

This library is useful when you cannot rely on zero values or when you need to avoid exporting mutability when it is not allowed or required.

## Inspiration

The function signatures and names are inspired by Rust's [Option enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html).
